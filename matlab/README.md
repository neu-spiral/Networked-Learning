## MATLAB code repo.

This repo includes the MATLAB implementation of our algorithms/simulations.

### Prerequisite
* Install CVX (see [this link](http://cvxr.com/cvx/)).

### Usage
* First, run `autoRunning.m`, which provides an interface to make configurations. It calls `main_simulation` which is the main function of the simulation.
* Then, run `Figure.m` and `Figure_beta.m` to draw figures for utility and estimation error comparisons, respectively.
